    "### Introduction\n",
    "In this notebook I will explore a text-based, document-based [dataset](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/tutorial/text_analytics/working_with_text_data.html) using scientific computing tools such as Pandas and Numpy. In addition, several fundamental Data Mining concepts will be explored and explained in details, ranging from calculating distance measures to computing term frequency vectors to visualizing embeddings. Coding examples, visualizations and demonstrations will be provided where necessary. Furthermore, additional exercises are provided after special topics. These exercises are geared towards testing the understanding of students and also for students to explore beyond, through programming practises, the techniques covered in the notebook. "

The dataset is called \"Twenty Newsgroups\", which means there are 20 categories of news articles available in the entire dataset. A short description of the dataset, provided by the authors, is provided below:\n",
    "\n",
    "- *The 20 Newsgroups data set is a collection of approximately 20,000 newsgroup documents, partitioned (nearly) evenly across 20 different newsgroups. To the best of our knowledge, it was originally collected by Ken Lang, probably for his paper “Newsweeder: Learning to filter netnews,” though he does not explicitly mention this collection. The 20 newsgroups collection has become a popular data set for experiments in text applications of machine learning techniques, such as text classification and text clustering.*\n",

    "Nice! Isn't it? With this format of the data we can conduct many operations, easily and efficiently, since Pandas dataframes provide us with a wide range of built-in features. These features are operations which can directly and quickly be applied to the dataset. These operations may include standard operations like removing records with missing values and aggregating new fields to the current state of the table (hereinafter referred to as a dataframe), which is desirable in almost every data mining project. If you are not covinced head on over to Kaggle -- one of the largest data science community on the web -- and see for yourself some of the top kernels and what they make use of. First thing you will notice is the use of Pandas to transform and explore data. Take a look at this [kernel](https://www.kaggle.com/arthurtok/introduction-to-ensembling-stacking-in-python) for example.\n",

    "First, let us consider that our dataset has some *missing values* and we want to remove those values. In its current state our dataset has no missing values, but for practice sake we will add some records with missing values and then write to code to deal with these object that contain missing value. You will see for yourself how easy it is to deatl with missing values once you have your data transformed into a Pandas dataframe.\n",
    "\n",
    "First let us do a quick review of what we learned in the Data Mining course. Specifically, how to deal with missing values and how they come about. \n",
    "\n",
    "The most common of cases for having missing values in datasets has to do with how the data was initially collected. A good example of this is when a patients comes into the ER room, the data is collected as quickly as possible and depending on the conditions of the patients, the personal data being collected it either incomplete or partially complete. In the former and latter cases, we are presented with a case of \"missing values\". Knowing that patients data is particularly critical and can be used by the health authorities to conduct some interesting analysis, we as the data miners are left with the tough task of deciding what to do with these missing and incomplete records. We need to deal with these records because they are definitely going to affect our analysis or algorithms. So what do we do? There are several ways to handle missing values, and some of the more effective ways are presented below (Note: You can reference the slides - Session 1 Handout for the additional information).\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Eliminate Data Objects** - Here we completely discard records once they contain some missing values. This is the easiest approach and the one we will be using in this notebook. The immediate drawback of going with this approach is that you loose information. Now imagine that half of the records have at least one or more missing values. Here you are presented with the tough decision of quantity vs quality. In any event, this decision must be made carefully, hence the reason for emphasizing it here in this notebook. \n",
    "\n",
    "- **Estimate Missing Values** - Here we try to estimate the missing values based on some criteria. Although this approach may be proven to be effective, it is not always the case, especially when we are dealing with sensitive data, like **Gender** or **Names**. For fields like **Address**, there could be ways to obtain these missing addresses using some data aggregation technique or obtain the information directly from other databases or public data sources.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Ignore the missing value during analysis** - Here we basically ignore the missing values and proceed with our analysis. Although this is the most naive way to handle missing values it may proof effective, especially when the missing values includes information that is not important to the analysis being conducted. But think about it for a while. Would you be ignore missing values, especially when in this day and age it is difficult to obtain high quality databases. Again, there are some tradeoffs, which will talk about later in the notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Replace with all possible values** - As an efficient and responsible data miner, we sometimes just need to put in the hard hours of work and find ways to makes up for these missing values. This last option is a very wise option for cases where data is scarce (which is almost always) or when dealing with sensitive data. Imagine that our dataset has an **Age** field, which contains many missing values. Since **Age** is a continuous variable, it means that we can build a separate model for calculating the age for the incomplete records based on some rule-based appraoch or probabilistic approach.  "

    "As mentioned earlier, we are going to go with the first option but you may be asked to compute missing values, using a different approach, as an exercise. So let's get to it!\n",
    "\n",
    "First we want to add the dummy records with missing values since the dataset we have is perfectly composed and cleaned that it contains no missing values. First let us check for ourselves that indeed the dataset doesn't contain any missing values. We can do that easily by using the following built-in function provided by Pandas.  "

As you will see above, and as we anticipated, our dataset looks clean and all values are present, since `isnull` return **False** for all fields and records. But let us start to get our hands dirty and build a nice little function to check each of the records, column by column, and return a nice little message telling us the amount of missing records collected. This excerice will also encourage us to explore the possibilities of pandas dataframes. In reality, the build function are good enough, but as you saw above when the entire table was printed, it is impossible really to tell if there are missing records just by looking at the records manually, especially in cases where the dataset is huge. Let's get to it!"

We then take the transformed table and apply a function to each that essentially counts to see if there are missing values in each records and how much missing values are there. In other words the `check_missing_values` function looks through each field in the dataset and counts how many missing values there are. \n",

    "### 4.2 Dealing with Duplicate Data\n",
    "Dealing with duplicate data is just as painful as dealing with missing data. The only difference between the two is that now there is more of the same. The worst case is that you have duplicate data that has missing values. But let us not get carried away. Let us keep it to the basics. As we have learned in our Data Mining course, duplicated data can occur because of many reasons. The majority of the times it has to do with how we store data or how we collect and merge data. For instance, we may collected and stored a tweet, and retweet of that same tweet as two different records. The result is case of data duplication; the only difference being that one is the original tweet and the other the retweeted one. Here you will learn that dealing with duplicate data is not as challenging as missing values. But this also all depends on what you consider as duplicates; this all depends on your criteria for what is considered as a duplicate and also what type of data you are dealing with. For text it may not be so trivial as it is for numerical values. Anyhow let us look at some code on how to deal with duplicate records in our `X` dataframe."

It appears that we don't have any duplicates since none of our records resulted in `True`. If we want to check for duplicates as we did above for some particular columns instead of all columns we do something as below. As you may have noticed, in this case where we select some columns instead of checking by all columns, we are kind of lowering the criteria of what is considered as a duplicate record.

But let us look at some examples for each data preprocessing technique that we learned in the class. We will cover each item one by one, and provide example code for each category.

    "The first concept that we are going to cover from the above list is sampling. Sampling refers to the technique used for selecting data. The functionalities that we use to  selected data through queries provided by Pandas are actually methods for sampling. The reasons for sampling are sometimes due to the size of data; we want a smaller subset of the data that still best represents the complete dataset. We don't have a problem of size in our dataset since our dataset is just a couple thousand records long. But if we pay attention to how much content is included in the `text` field of each of those records, you will realize that sampling may not be a bad idea. In fact, we have already done some sampling by just reducing the records we are using here in this notebook; we only used four categories from the all the 20 categories available. Let us get an idea of what sampling involves in terms of using pandas code."

    "I must also make mention that there are other libraries for visualizing, but we are going to focus on that in the later sections. For now, we just show you what are the ways to sample and to verify the distributions of your samplings. I can't resits it, but actually, there is an easier to generate the chart we generated above using a library called `matplotlib`. With matplotlib, things are faster and compatability-wise it may just be the best visualization library for visualizing content extracted from dataframes. Let's quickly take a loot at the magic of `matplotlib` below."

Actually there are many ways to conduct sampling on the dataset and still have a representative enough dataset. That is not the main focus in this notebook, but if you would like to know more about sampling and how the `sample` feature works, just reference the Pandas documentation and you will find interesting ways to conduct more advanced sampling."

    "### 5.2 Feature Creation\n",
    "The other operation from the list above that we are going to practise on is the so-called feature creation. As the name suggests, in feature creation we are looking at creating new interesting and useful features from the original dataset; a feature which captures the most important information from the raw information we already have access to. In our `X` table, we would like to create some features from the `text` field, but we are still not clear what kind of features we want to create. We can think of an interesting problem we want to solve, or something we want to analyze from the data, or some questions we want to answer. This is one process to come up with features -- this process is usually called `feature engineering` in the data science community. \n",
    "\n",
    "We know what feature creation is so let us get real involved with our dataset and make it more interesting by adding some special features or attributes if you will. First we are going to obtain the **unigrams** for each text. (Unigram is just a fancy word we use in Text Mining which stands for 'individual words'.) Yes, we want to extract all the words found in each text and append it as a new feature. The reason for extracting unigrams is not so clear yet, but we can start to think of obtaining some statistics about the articles we have: something like **word distribution** or **word frequency**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before going into any further coding, we will also introduce some basic library called [NLTK](http://www.nltk.org/). The NLTK library is a natural language processing tool used for text mining tasks, so might as well we start to familiarize ourselves with it from now (It may come in handy for the final project!). In partcular, we are going to use the NLTK library to conduct tokenization because we are interested in splitting a sentence into its individual components, which can be words, emojis, emails, etc. So let us go for it! We can call the `nltk` library as follows:\n",

Given our current original dataset, we would like to transform one of the attributes, `category_name`, into four binary attributes. In other words, we are taking the category name and replacing it with a `n` asymmetric binary attributes. The logic behind this transformation is dicussed in detail in the required text book (please refer to it on page 58). People from the Deep Learning community also refer to this transformation as one-hot encoding, but as you may become aware later in the course, these concepts are all the same, we just have different prefrence on how we refer to the concetps.

You should feel excited and proud because the process of Data Mining usually involves 70% preprocessing and 30% training algorithms. You will learn this as you progress in the Data Mining course. I really feel that if you go through the exercise and challenge yourself, you have just become an expert. \n",

    "After completing this notebook you can do a lot with the results we have generated. You can train algorithms and models that are able to classify articles into certain categories and much more. You can also try to experiment with different datasets, or venture further into text analytics by using new deep learning techniques such as word2vec. All of this will be presented in the next lab session. Until then, go teach machines how to be intelligent to make the world a better place. "
